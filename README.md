# Digital-Synthesizer

## What it does
Modular design allows you to choose different wave generators and hook them up to mixers using virtual cables to make interesting sounds!

## Purpose of this project
Improve my knowledge of and experience with Java inheritance

## The implementation
I used Java's system of inheritance to build the various types of similar wave generators and sound mixers. The JavaFX library was used for the visualization of the generator and mixer boxes as well as the "cables".
